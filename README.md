streamlit run app/main.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

3. Upload an image using the file uploader

4. Click "Analyze Image" to process the image and generate audio description

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **Image Analyzer**: Uses the BLIP model from Salesforce for image captioning
2. **Speech Generator**: Utilizes gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for audio generation
3. **Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction

### Workflow

1. User uploads an image through the Streamlit interface
2. Image is validated and temporarily stored
3. Image Analyzer processes the image and generates a detailed description
4. Speech Generator converts the description to audio
5. Results are displayed with both text and audio options

## Performance Optimizations

- Efficient file handling with automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Optimized image processing pipeline
- Streamlined audio generation process
- Minimal memory footprint with temporary file management

## Future Improvements

- Support for multiple languages
- Batch processing capabilities
- More detailed image analysis with object detection
- Custom voice options for speech synthesis
- Integration with screen readers
